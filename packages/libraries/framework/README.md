# Framework package

Currently this is a private package, used only to run the webpack bundle analyzer on the framework. After running the bundle command there will be a framework.stats.html file that can be viewed to look at the composition of the bundle.

Long term it may be beneficial to roll up the various packages into a single framework packages. For right now though this is internal only.
