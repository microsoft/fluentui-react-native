 * compartmentalize the logic.
 *
 * Note that for this to be safe, hooks cannot be used in the function. This is the reason why function component is redefined,
 * to help linting tools catch bad usage.

 * MULTI-STAGE RENDERING
 *
 * The above direct rendering pattern is useful for simple components, but it does not allow for hooks or complex logic. The staged render pattern allows
 * for a component to be rendered in two stages, allowing for hooks to be used in the first stage and then the second stage to be a simple render function that can
 * be called directly.
 *
 * In code that respects the pattern the first stage will be called with props (though children will not be present) and will return a function that will be called
 * with additional props, this time with children present. This allows for the first stage to handle all the logic and hooks, while the second stage can be a simple render function
 * that can leverage direct rendering if supported.
 *
 * The component itself will be a FunctionComponent, but it will have an attached property that is the staged render function. This allows the component to be used in two
 * parts via the useSlot hook, or to be used directly in JSX/TSX as a normal component.
