  /**
   * Defines event redirection behaviors for pointer events relative to the Callout control.
   *
   * Pointer events (i.e. mouse, pen, touch) often have the effect of initiating and dismissing Callout controls.
   * Typically the instigating events are click events, but when using a mouse may also include pointer enter
   * and leave events i.e. hover.  Once opened, many Callout scenarios desire modal-like interactions, where
   * the user must interact with or relative to the Callout before interacting with other controls again. A common
   * example is context menus, where pointer events away from the menu may dismiss the context menu.  Such an interaction
   * can initiate unintended actions such as invoking a button or otherwise pointer-responsive surface.  The modal-like
   * behavior is the most common case of Callout usage, and having "safe" areas to press-dismiss the Callout without
   * invoking additional actions is useful.
   *
   * This modal-like behavior, where true modal behavior would specifically require interacting with the modal component until
   * it is dismissed, has implications for canonical event routing in React-Native.  Canonically all pointer events are passed in
   * a Capture phase from the root element to the target element, then bubbled back from the target element to the root element.
   * This structure allows many interaction patterns to be implemented that may include stopping event routing in each phase.
   * This event routing can disrupt the modal-like behavior desired by a Callout control, which in native frameworks may take
   * advantage of a "take event capture" feature -- making the Callout the first handler of the pointer event.  The event may optionally
   * be forwarded afterwards to the canonical event routing pattern for further handling (and often is not forwarded).
   *
   * One impact of "taking event capture" is the implicit behavior for mouse events on the parent surface of the Callout -- if
   * event capture is taken by the Callout, paired events may fire such as a mouse leave event.  This makes sense if we think about
   * the event behavior after the Callout has taken capture; mouse enter and mouse leave events would only propagate to the parent surface
   * if the Callout event handling decided to forward said events (often not).  As paired events, however, there should not be a
   * mouse enter event without a corresponding mouse leave event (or vice versa).  Since mouse enter and mouse leave events would not
   * naturally fire on the parent surface when the Callout has pointer capture, the parent surface should receive a mouse leave event when
   * the Callout takes capture.
   *
   * Coming back to the start of this comment, some Callout scenarios may be initiated by mouse enter/leave events.  A common example is
   * tooltips, which are supported on lower-level React-Native components, but such behavior is not exclusive to tooltips.
   * The Callout control is generally used for more advanced scenarios, as mentioned before often desiring modal-like behavior and accordingly
   * the default behavior of the Callout control is to take pointer capture.  Accounting for the paired mouse enter/leave events in the paragraph
   * above, it is difficult to have a mouse enter/leave-invoked Callout that takes pointer capture -- without significant workarounds,
   * the Callout would open and close cyclically from repeated mouse enter/leave events.  There are other scenarios where taking pointer capture
   * is not desirable, such as a semi-persistent Callout; to support these scenarios the doNotTakePointerCapture property is offered to
   * specify if the Callout should not take pointer capture when it opens.
   *
   * While pointer capture is generally managed in native frameworks via imperative APIs, managing pointer capture is offered as a property that
   * only affects the Callout's on-show behavior when it would typically take pointer capture.  This design implies that changing this property after
   * the Callout has been shown has no effect -- similar to the Callout's onShow callback.  Doing so simplifies Callout usage for developers,
   * not needing to mind native platform pointer capture that may be complex particularly when React-Native is integrated into a larger app.
   * Pointer capture may be lost (and regained) but is otherwise abstracted away from the developer.  More advanced control of pointer capture
   * would need to be provided by a native module independent of any particular control.
   *
   * When the Callout is closed, pointer capture is released by the Callout and further handled by the native platform -- generally returning
   * pointer capture to the parent surface.
