# Link

(Once moved from Experimental to Components)
In the short term, the new `Link` control is named `LinkV1` while it clashes with the existing older control. Once we deprecate the old control, it will be renamed to `Link`. It may be useful to rename the control to `Link` using the import syntax to simplify the rename:

```ts
import { LinkV1 as Link } from '@fluentui-react-native/link';
```

FURN components that have imported from experimental-link will use the above syntax to use `LinkV1`.

## Background

The `Link` component is a clickable control primarily used for navigation, providing an interactive reference to a resource. It is usually displayed as an block element by default, but can be displayed inline as well.

## Requirements

If using FURN's theming, the `Link` requires use of the `ThemeProvider` from `@fluentui-react-native/theme` to work properly with themes. Please see [this page](../../../docs/pages/Guides/UpdateThemeProvider.md) for information on updating your `ThemeProvider` if using the version from `@uifabricshared/theming-react-native`.

## Sample Code

Basic example:

```jsx
<Link url="https://www.bing.com/">Click to Navigate.</Link>
```

More examples on the [Test pages for Link](../../../apps/fluent-tester/src/TestComponents/LinkV1). Instructions on running the tester app can be found [here](../../../apps/fluent-tester/README.md).

## Visual Examples

Win32:

![Default Links on win32 example](./assets/Link_example_default_win32.png)

```jsx
<Link tooltip={'https://www.bing.com/'} url="https://www.bing.com/">
  Click to navigate.
</Link>
<Link onPress={doPress} onAccessibilityTap={doAllyTap}>
  Click to alert.
</Link>
<Link disabled focusable>
  Disabled focusable Link
</Link>
```

![Subtle Links on win32 example](./assets/Link_example_subtle_win32.png)

```jsx
<Link appearance="subtle" url="https://www.bing.com/">
  Click to navigate.
</Link>
<Link appearance="subtle" onPress={doPress} disabled>
  Disabled Link
</Link>
```

![Customized Links on win32 example](./assets/Link_example_customized_win32.png)

```jsx
const BlueHeaderBold = Link.customize({ variant: 'headerStandard', fontWeight: '700', color: '#0229c4', textAlign: 'right' });
<BlueHeaderBold>BlueHeaderBold</BlueHeaderBold>;
```

## API

The default `Link` control is rendered as a FURN Text(`Text`) wrapped in a `react-native` View. However, inline `Link` is rendered purely as a FURN Text(`Text`) without a wrapping View.

### Props

Below is the set of props the Text supports:

```ts
export interface LinkProps extends IWithPressableOptions<TextProps> {
  /**
   * The appearance of the link, either `default` or `subtle`
   * Note: 'subtle' is not supported for Android
   * @default default
   */
  appearance?: LinkAppearance;
  /**
   * A RefObject to access the IButton interface. Use this to access the public methods and properties of the component.
   */
  componentRef?: React.RefObject<IFocusable>;
  /**
   * Whether to use native focus visuals for the component
   * @default true
   */
  enableFocusRing?: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether the link is inline with text
   * Note: Not supported for win32
   * @default false
   */
  inline?: boolean;
  /**
   * The URL that is opened when the link is clicked.  This value supersedes the 'onPress' callback when both are present.
   * @default undefined
   */
  url?: string;
  /**
   * Text that should show in a tooltip when the user hovers over a button.
   * Note: Not supported for Android
   */
  tooltip?: string;
}
```

### Styling Tokens

Tokens can be used to customize the styling of the control by using the `customize` function on the `Link`. For more information on using the `customize` API, please see [this page](../../framework/composition/README.md). The `Link` has the following tokens:

```ts
export interface LinkTokens extends TextTokens {
  hovered?: LinkTokens;
  pressed?: LinkTokens;
  focused?: LinkTokens;
  visited?: LinkTokens;
  disabled?: LinkTokens;
  inline?: LinkTokens;
  subtle?: LinkTokens;
}
```

Note: 'hovered','focused','visited','subtle' are not supported for Android

## Behaviors

### Link with url

`Text` can be rendered as pressable.

### Interaction

#### Keyboard interaction

The following is a set of keys that interact with the `Link` component:

| Key     | Description                                                                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`   | If `disabled` is not set, component will gain focus.                                                |
| `Space` | Nagivates to the path passed in as a `url` or executes the function passed into the `onPress` prop. |

#### Cursor interaction for Link

- Cursor moves onto Link: Should immediately change the styling of the `Link` so that it appears to be hovered. Cursor changes to `pointer`.
- Cursor moves out of Link: Should immediately remove the hovered styling of the `Link`. Cursor changes to `arrow`.
- Cursor moves onto disabled Link: Cursor changes to `not-allowed`.
- Mouse click: Navigate to `url` or should handle `onPress` event of `Link` and move focus to its target.

#### Touch interaction

The same behavior as above translated for touch events. This means that there is no equivalent for `onHoverIn` and `onHoverOut`, which makes it so that the hovered state cannot be accessed.

## Accessibility

### Expected behavior

- accessibleRole: `link`
- Should mix in the accessibility props expected for a `Link` component.
- Should be keyboard tabbable and focusable.
- onAccessibilityTap defaults to onPress unless set otherwise
