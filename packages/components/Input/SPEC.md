# Input

## Background

The `Input` component enables users to enter and edit text.

## Requirements

If using FURN's theming, the `Input` requires use of the `ThemeProvider` from `@fluentui-react-native/theme` to work properly with themes. Please see [this page](../../../docs/pages/Guides/UpdateThemeProvider.md) for information on updating your `ThemeProvider` if using the version from `@uifabricshared/theming-react-native`.

## Sample Code

Basic examples:

```jsx
<Input />
<Input placeholder="Custom dismiss icon" accessoryIcon={outlineIconProps} secondaryText="Secondary" type="decimal-pad" />
<Input
  placeholder="Enter text here!"
  accessoryIcon={dismissIconProps}
  label="Label"
  assistiveText="Assistive Text"
  secondaryText="Secondary"
/>
```

More examples on the [Test pages for the Input](../../../apps/fluent-tester/src/TestComponents/Input). Instructions on running the tester app can be found [here](../../../apps/fluent-tester/README.md).

## Visual Examples

Android:

![Input](./assets/input_light.jpg)

```tsx
const [error, setError] = React.useState<string>('');
export const dismissIconProps: IconProps = { svgSource: { src: DismissSvg, viewBox: '0 0 20 20' } };
<Input
  error={error}
  icon={outlineIconProps}
  focusedStateIcon={filledIconProps}
  textInputProps={{ autoFocus: true }}
  placeholder="Only text upto 5 characters!"
  assistiveText="Assistive Text"
  label="Label"
  onChange={(text: string) => {
    if (text.length > 5) setError('Text must be less than 5 characters!');
    else setError('');
  }}
/>;
```

At rest with no input text, the input shows the placeholder text.

Once the user selects the text input, the label and icon are re-coloured. It is recommended to pass filled version of the icon to be used in focus state.

![Input focused state](./assets/input_focused_light.jpg)

Once the user starts typing, the accessory text and icon are shown. The default accessory icon is shown here and behaves like a clear text button. Both the icon and its functionality are overridable.

Once the user is done and taps away, the input switches back to the unfocused state with neutral colors, but continues to show the accessory views as long as the input text isn't empty.

![Input filled state](./assets/input_filled_light.jpg)

The input also takes an error string, if set, it replaces the assistive text with the error's localized description and recolors the title, separator, and assistive text to indicate an invalid input.

## Variants

### Icon

The `Input` component can include an `icon` that appears before the text field. Passing just one icon is enough, but it is recommended to also pass the `focusedStateIcon`. The outline version is to be passed in the `icon` while it's filled version is to be passed to the `focusedStateIcon`. This icon is used when the input is in focus.

### Accessory Icon/Text

The `Input` component can include an `accessoryIcon` and `accessoryText` that appears on the right of the text field. These are shown only when the input has some text in it. By default the `accessoryIcon` fuctions as a clear text button. This can be disabled by setting the prop to null. Funcationality of the `accessoryIcon` can be modified using `accessoryButtonOnPress`.

## API

### Slots

The `Input` component has ten slots, or parts. The slots behave as follows:

- `root` - The outer container representing the `Input` itself.
- `icon` - If specified, renders an `icon` before the text input.
- `accessoryIcon` - Renders an `accessoryIcon` after the text input.
- `accessoryIconPressable` - Pressable layer that handles onPress on `accessoryIcon`.
- `accessoryText` - If specified, renders `accessoryText` after the text input.
- `textInput` - Text Input from react native that provides the functional behaviors.
- `input` - Wrapper view that contains the `textInput`, `accessoryIconPressable` and `accessoryText`. Provides bottom margin of the input.
- `inputWrapper` - Wrapper view that contains `input` and `icon`, this is used to align icon properly with the input regardless of presence/absence of `label` and `assistiveText`.
- `label` - Text displayed over the text input.
- `assistiveText` - Additional text displayed on the bottom of the text input.

The slots can be modified using the `compose` function on the `Input`. For more information on using the `compose` API, please see [this page](../../framework/composition/README.md).

### Props

Below is the set of props the input supports:

```ts
export interface InputProps {

### Styling Tokens

Tokens can be used to customize the styling of the control by using the `customize` function on the `Input`. For more information on using the `customize` API, please see [this page](../../framework/composition/README.md). The `Input` has the following tokens:

```ts
export interface InputTokens extends LayoutTokens, IBorderTokens, IColorTokens, FontTokens {
  /**
   * The icon color.
   */
  iconColor?: ColorValue;

  /**
   * The size of the icon.
   */
  iconSize?: number;

  /**
   * The dismiss icon color.
   */
  accessoryIconColor?: ColorValue;

  /**
   * The size of the dismiss icon.
   */
  accessoryIconSize?: number;

  /**

   * The input's vertical margin.
   */
  spacingInputVertical?: number;

  /**
   * The assistive text's vertical margin.
   */
  spacingAssistiveTextVertical?: number;

  /**

}
```

## Behaviors

### States

The following section describes the different states which `Input` can be in as a result of interaction.

#### Placeholder state

Default state of `Input`. The placeholder is displayed, there is no text typed into the input.

#### Focused state

Once the user selects the text input, the label and icon are re-coloured. It is recommended to pass filled version of the icon to be used in focus state.

#### Typing state

Once the user starts typing, the accessory text and icon are shown. The default accessory icon is shown here and behaves like a clear text button. Both the icon and its functionality are overridable.

#### Filled state

Once the user is done and taps away, the input switches back to the unfocused state with neutral colors, but continues to show the accessory views as long as the input text isn't empty.

#### Error state

The input also takes an error string, if set, it replaces the assistive text with the error's localized description and recolors the title, separator, and assistive text to indicate an invalid input.

## Accessibility

### Expected behavior

- Should read out placeholder text when focused, allow the user to interact with the text input and read out any pre-filled text when focused.
- Should allow user to type into the text input.
- Should allow user to read the label, assistive text and accessory text.
- Should allow the user to set custom accessibility label and interact with the accessory button.
- Should be keyboard tabbable and focusable.

See [`useInput` hook](./src/useInput.ts) for details on accessibility props
