# Current capability and qualification status

**Work in progress, updated 2026-11-06.** "Done" below means the stated
implementation exists, not that every native endpoint is qualified or that the
complete orchestration product is ready for submission. Historical measurements
remain tied to their original revision; they were not rerun by this update.
See [architecture](architecture.md) for boundaries and
[remaining work](remaining-work.md) for open delivery gates. Follow-up
lifecycle, orchestration, and qualification work is tracked in
[desktop driver improvements (#4435)](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native/issues/4435)
and its sub-issues, which record dependencies and parallel waves.

The approved direction is a stronger `desktop-test` workload host, with native
authority here and MCP as a client. No coordinator package or daemon is being
added. Management/run schemas stay in the harness, not this package.

Hosted Windows policy disables physical input and can reject capture with
`0x80070057`. Capability-gated skips must stay explicit. `activate` succeeding
does not qualify a refused physical click. Each new lifecycle/native change
needs its own endpoint evidence; a final aggregate matrix is not a substitute.
Live requalification of these lanes is tracked in
[#4441](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native/issues/4441), and
the repeated-run support matrix in
[#4451](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native/issues/4451).

### 2026-11-06: bounded F4 restart qualification

Source revision `6fca1478871f41ec884fb4bd2cff66cff8197833` includes mainline
`cd0ede21489c9ab8cb76fea07c4dec2e9699389f` through merge
`35057966aeb20b70756af4e83c58c3242675aa72`. macOS arm64 Paper and Fabric
were run separately. These are bounded acceptance checks, not full smoke or
reliability passes.

**Passed:** the nonprompting preflight
`FURN_DESKTOP_DRIVER_BUILD_POLICY=never yarn desktop-driver doctor --platform macos --permissions`
reported AX, PostEvent and screenCapture all `true`. The cached helper retained
cdhash `0d2e7a81dfd4695b7fb84aa1b3242f5e1773e8b4`; no helper rebuild, permission
prompt, TCC change or unrestricted capture was used.

**Passed separately for Paper and Fabric:** authenticated button navigation,
actual native marker conformance, rejection of an old preview reference after
another selection, and continued usability of an existing chrome reference.
The bounded authored command was
`FURN_DESKTOP_DRIVER_BUILD_POLICY=never yarn storybook test --macos --test '*exposes enabled button semantics*'`
(append `--paper` for Paper). Passing authored run IDs, beneath
`apps/storybook/artifacts/desktop/`, were
`c462e891-a755-4a27-9b63-9eb07f64934b` (Paper) and
`cd1ef4ac-8f38-4d3e-ac06-0d957ade0207` (Fabric).

**Passed separately for Paper and Fabric:** stop the entire driver supervisor
while preserving the authenticated app; start a fresh driver; verify the
unchanged authenticated epoch and exact live PID/start time. The story route
returned `relaunch-required`, the matching renderer, and mutation effect
`none`. The same bounded authored command intentionally failed navigation
with that typed error; it is not an authored-test pass. Independent native
route assertions passed. The private endpoint/target storage namespace and
epoch survived the service restart without relying on the rotated manifest.

**Passed separately for Paper and Fabric:** quit the recorded app and driver,
launch a replacement app before its channel exists, then restart the driver.
The route returned `bridge-unavailable`, effect `none`, and removed the exited
incarnation's record. A subsequent no-record check remained unavailable.
Initial absence before authentication also returned unavailable, effect `none`.
Early Paper startup attempts failed navigation while the runtime was not ready;
they remain failures, not passes hidden by the later settled run. The earlier
Fabric full-catalog traversal with app-stop AppleEvent `-1712` remains a failed
smoke command; bounded reruns used verified-process cleanup instead.

**Passed:** focused and owning-package checks, clean-cache `yarn lage buildci`
(178 tasks), and `yarn lage test-links --verbose --grouped` (90 tasks).
Private session evidence is retained under `files/f4-validation/`:
`restart-{paper,fabric}-{markers,record,assert,replaced-assert}.log`,
`restart-permissions.log`, `restart-buildci.log` and `restart-test-links.log`.
After both lanes, owned apps, supervisors, Metro, channels and helpers were
stopped; ports 23489, 39627 and 30542 and the interactive lock were verified
clear, and the exclusive validation slot was released.

**Not run natively:** post-dispatch cancellation, delayed ready/error/render
fault injection, fresh-preview actions after lost context, secondary windows
and physical input. **Not run:** Windows Fabric and Win32 Paper qualification.
Portable contract coverage is not native evidence for these gaps.

## Measurement ledger

Preserved from the former root capability report, not newly measured here.
Use **Measured** for observed product/recorded-run data, **Estimate** for
synthetic/token-formula calculations, and **Not run** for missing evidence.
Do not silently replace historical rows with current claims.

### 2026-11-04: delivered operation text costs at `41fc7473f`

**Measured.** macOS Fabric Storybook, 2720 x 1988-pixel window (1360 x 994
points, 2x display), served by `yarn storybook driver --macos --agent`.
An MCP SDK stdio client rendered `components-button--default`,
`components-checkbox--default`, and `components-menu--default`, each
marker-confirmed. Baseline routes and new operations sampled the same app
state. `o200k_base` token counts include every returned text block and the
result envelope; all observations were complete, without truncation.

Envelope overhead was about 150 tokens for observation/delta payloads, not a
universal floor for every operation. Include MCP discovery separately:

### 2026-11-02 baseline: recorded evidence at `c84acb741`

**Measured from 61 recorded macOS failure-evidence sets**, not a new live
session. Same tokenizer and window dimensions; different app states from the
November 4 comparison. Median full tree: 157 nodes, 69 interactive roles,
12 testIDs, maximum depth three.

| Representation               | Median tokens | Range or limitation                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Pretty tree evidence         | 14.2k         | 11.6k-18.4k; about 70 KB                 |
| Minified tree                | 7.8k          | Same retained evidence                   |
| Minified tree without rects  | 4.8k          | Less information, not equivalent content |
| Legacy application describe  | 9.4k          | Depth 3 / 100-node bound                 |
| Legacy story-scoped describe | 223           | Maximum 2.1k                             |
| XML page source              | 6.8k          | Recorded source                          |
| Window events                | 5.0k          | Full 512 + 128-entry ring                |

Earlier synthetic compact-outline estimates (824 tokens all named nodes,
683 interactive, 39 story-scoped) excluded delivered references/action metadata
and envelopes. They are **not measurements** and must not be used as product
targets already achieved. The screenshot estimate of about 1,530 Claude or
1,105 OpenAI high-detail image tokens applied then-published resize formulas to
the 2720 x 1988 PNG; it is not measured billing or a current model guarantee.
Third-party agent-device comparisons were not same-app measurements and are not
retained as product evidence.

Do not subtract helper timings from end-to-end timings or compare them as a
controlled speedup. Five reads estimated as one interactive observation and
four unchanged deltas cost about 1.7k-2.1k text tokens **plus discovery**; that
is a calculated scenario, not an observed five-turn agent session.

### Recording the next measurement

Append a dated run with commit, OS/architecture, renderer, application/story,
window dimensions/scale, helper build/signing mode, cold/warm state, sample
count, tokenizer/version, exact projection/budgets, completeness, text blocks
included, discovery overhead, and client-versus-helper timing boundary.
Retain an approved artifact/report locator without credentials, private paths,
application text, or raw screenshots. Record missing artifacts as unavailable.
The historical report did not retain a portable raw-artifact locator or tokenizer
package version; those provenance gaps remain, rather than inventing them.

Report p50/p90/max with sample count, retries, failures, skipped capabilities,
and cleanup status. Compare equivalent assertions and complete scopes.
Windows and Paper measurements need their own rows; do not extrapolate macOS
Fabric numbers.
