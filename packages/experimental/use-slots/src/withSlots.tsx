/**
 * This function is required for any module that uses slots.
 *
 * This function is a slot resolver that automatically evaluates slot functions to generate React elements.
 * A byproduct of this resolver is that it removes slots from the React hierarchy by bypassing React.createElement.
 *
 * To use this function on a per-file basis, use the jsx directive targeting withSlots.
 * This directive must be the FIRST LINE in the file to work correctly.
 * Usage of this pragma also requires withSlots import statement.
 *
 * See React.createElement
