- [Azure Credentials Plugin for NuGet](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider#manual-installation-on-windows)
  - We're currently on an expermental version of react-native-windows which is being published to a private NPM feed hosted on Azure DevOps.

### Add the App Signing Certificate to your Personal Certificate Store

As with normal UWP app development, the UWP test harness that loads the JS bundle must have a developer-signed certificate present to install the APPX package.

1. Windows+R to open the Run Dialog and type in `certmgr.msc`. **NOTE:** For some reason this takes some time on my machine.
2. Expand `Personal` and right click on `Certificates`
3. Under `All tasks` click `Import`
4. For the Current User, `Browse` to find `FluentTester_TemporaryKey.pfx` in your local clone of the repo. It is currently under [fluentui-react-native/apps/windows/windows/FluentTester](windows/FluentTester).
5. On the next page, type in 'password' for the password.

## Running the App

1. Run `yarn` from the root of the repo
2. From this directory, simply `yarn windows`

## Troubleshooting

### EPERM restoring NuGet packages

If you see an error like the following:

```
- Restoring NuGet packages
Ã— Failed to restore the NuGet packages: Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink C:\Users\adrum\AppData\Local\Temp\nuget.4.9.2.exe'
```

Double check that you have correctly installed the Azure Credentials Plugin for NuGet mentioned in the Prerequisites above.
