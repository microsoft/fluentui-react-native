Add reusable platform-aware configuration and CLI APIs for serving, preparing, bundling, building, running, and smoke testing desktop Storybook applications. The package now owns complete Windows Fabric and Win32 smoke lifecycles, native host launch, synchronized story traversal, desktop UX checks, process cleanup, and per-enlistment bundle and service isolation. React Native runtime code and peers are isolated in a companion package so Yarn's pnpm linker can invoke the peer-free CLI through a physical workspace locator.
