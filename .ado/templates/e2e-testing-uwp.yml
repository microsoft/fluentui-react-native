  # Creates a variable that determines whether the previous build tasks succeeded.
  # Usage: We want the tasks that generate reports to run for both passing/failing E2E testing tasks. In order to do so, we need to make
  # those reporting tasks run even on when certain previous tasks fail. This variable allows us to differentiate build failures from
  # E2E testing failures. Thus, if this variable != "Success", we know the build failed, and to not run the reporting tasks.
