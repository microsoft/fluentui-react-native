# FluentUI React Native

FluentUI React Native is a javascript component library that provides developers with controls that are part of the [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/). These controls are built on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and fully customizable.

## Getting Started

If you have an existing React Native project, it's easy to begin using FluentUI React Native. If you need to setup a new React Native project, please see the [React Native Windows Getting Started documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/getting-started).

### Prerequisites

- [Standard React Native dependencies](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#node-python2-jdk)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Install FluentUI React Native into an existing project

Navigate to the root folder of your project, and use npm to install the package:

```
 npm i @fluentui/react-native
```

After successful installation, you can test the package by importing components at the top of your app's entry file, e.g. `App.js`:

```
 import { Checkbox } from '@fluentui/react-native';
```

Once you have the package installed, check out our [Hello World Fluent page](https://github.com/microsoft/fluent-site/blob/master/packages/fluent-website/docs/windows/get-started/Hello-World.mdx) to start writing code (Coming Soon).
