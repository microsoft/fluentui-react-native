# Tabs

## Purpose

The Tabs control and related tabs pattern are used for navigating frequently accessed, distinct content categories. Tabs allow for navigation between two or more content views and relies on text headers to articulate the different sections of content.
Selecting a tab item header navigates to that header's section content.

## Do's:

- Use on content-heavy views that require a significant amount of scrolling to access the various sections.
- Be concise on the navigation header texts, ideally one or two words rather than a phrase.
- Make sure all the children of the Tabs component are of type TabItem.

## Don't:

- Nest with other RadioGroup or Checkboxes. If possible, keep all the options at the same level.
- Use on Views which don’t scroll.
- Use the Tabs to access a different global view.
- Use the Tabs to access hidden content.
- Pass any children of type other than TabItem to the Tabs component.

## Sample Code:

```jsx
<Tabs>
  <TabsItem headerText="Home" itemKey="A">
    <Text>Tabs #1</Text>
  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem headerText="Files" itemKey="B">
    <Text>Tabs #2</Text>
  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem headerText="Settings" itemKey="C">
    <Text>Tabs #3</Text>
  </TabsItem>
</Tabs>
```
