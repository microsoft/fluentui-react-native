# Callout

## Purpose

A callout is an anchored tip that can be used to teach people or guide them through the app without blocking them.

## Do's:

- Place a callout near the object being described. At the pointer’s tail or head, if possible.

## Don't:

- Don't use large, unformatted blocks of text in your callout. They're difficult to read and overwhelming.
- Don’t block important UI with the placement of your callout. It's a poor user experience that will lead to frustration
- Don’t open a callout from within another callout.
- Don’t show callouts on hidden elements.
- Don’t overuse callouts. Too many callouts opening automatically can be perceived as interrupting someone's workflow.

## Sample Code:

### Rectangle Shimmer

```jsx
const customCallout: React.FunctionComponent = () => {
  const [showCustomizedCallout, setShowCustomizedCallout] = React.useState(false);
  const [isCustomizedCalloutVisible, setIsCustomizedCalloutVisible] = React.useState(false);

  const toggleShowCustomizedCallout = React.useCallback(() => {
    setShowCustomizedCallout(!showCustomizedCallout);

    // Unmounting a callout does not invoke onDismiss; onDismiss is only invoked
    // for dismissals generated by the native app.  When toggling to 'show',
    // the isVisible state will be corrected to 'true' by the onShow callback.
    setIsCustomizedCalloutVisible(false);
  }, [showCustomizedCallout, setIsCustomizedCalloutVisible, setShowCustomizedCallout]);

  const onShowCustomizedCallout = React.useCallback(() => {
    setIsCustomizedCalloutVisible(true);
  }, [setIsCustomizedCalloutVisible]);

  const onDismissCustomizedCallout = React.useCallback(() => {
    setIsCustomizedCalloutVisible(false);

    // setting the internal state to false will instigate unmounting the
    // zombie Callout control.
    setShowCustomizedCallout(false);
  }, [setIsCustomizedCalloutVisible, setShowCustomizedCallout]);

  const myRect: ScreenRect = { screenX: 10, screenY: 10, width: 100, height: 100 };

  return (
    <View>
      <View style={{ flexDirection: 'column', paddingVertical: 5 }}>
        <Button content="Press for Callout" onClick={toggleShowCustomizedCallout} />
        <Text selectable={true}>
          <Text>Visibility: </Text>
          {isCustomizedCalloutVisible ? <Text style={{ color: 'green' }}>Visible</Text> : <Text style={{ color: 'red' }}>Not Visible</Text>}
        </Text>
      </View>

      {showCustomizedCallout && (
        <Callout
          anchorRect={myRect}
          onDismiss={onDismissCustomizedCallout}
          onShow={onShowCustomizedCallout}
          accessibilityLabel="Customized Callout"
          accessibilityRole="alert"
          accessibilityOnShowAnnouncement="Be informed that a customized callout has been opened."
        >
          <View style={{ padding: 20, borderWidth: 2, borderColor: 'black' }}>
            <Text>just some text so it does not take focus and is not empty.</Text>
          </View>
        </Callout>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};
```

| dismissBehaviors | DismissBehaviors[] |               | Defines variations on how the callout dismissal may be controlled. the async eventing of React-Native makes passing some aspects of dismissal control over to JS difficult. Moreover, the native platform or host may have competing priorities with regards to transient UI that generate bi-directional lifetime management between JS (which mounts and unmounts the component) and native (which may tear down the transient UI without JS input). This property provides control over the latter issue, enabling relevant native platform interactions with transient UI to be managed from JS. These behaviors should generally be orthogonal, and therefore combinable. |
