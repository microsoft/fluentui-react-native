# Accessibility

Accessibility means designing and creating UI that's accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
It's important to create accessible UI so that assitive technology, like screen readers, can access information users 
need to interact with your contorls. Here you can find a guide to get started as well as tools to help you test your UI 
for accessibility.

## Our Approach
FluentUI React Native enables developers to create accessible UI by providing APIs that are complimentary to Microsoft
UI Automation (UIA), an accessibility framework for Windows. Our API surface is heavly inspired by Accessible Internet Rich 
Applications (ARIA), an accessibility framework for the web. We chose to align with ARIA to provide a "web first" 
development experience. ARIA also provides a lot of guidelines and best practices for creating accessible content.

## Making UI accessible

FluentUI React Native components are accessible by default meaning you only need to provide minimal customizations to make
your UI accessible. Here you will find information the folowing components: Properties, Roles, States, and Actions.

### Properties

#### accessible
When ```true```, indicates that the view is an accessible element meaning it receives accessibility focus. By default, all 
controls are accessible. 

```tsx
<Text accessible={true}>first</Text>
<Text accessible={false}>second</Text>
```

In the above example, 'first' recieves accessiblity focus but 'second' does not. 


#### accessibilityLabel
When something is accessible, it's good practice to set an ```accessiblityLabel``` so the user knows what element they have
selected. Narrator will read out this string when the user places focus on the control.

To use, set the ```accessibilityLabel``` property to a custom string:

```tsx
<Button content="Click me" accessibilityLabel="Press me" />
```

In the above example, Narrator will read "Press me" instead of "Click me".

#### accessibilityHint

An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they preform an action on the accessibility element when
the result isn't clear from the accessibility label.

To use, set the ```accessibilityHint``` property to a custom string:

```tsx
<Button content="Back" accessibilityLabel="Go Back" accessibilityHint="Navigates to the previous screen" />
```

In the above example, Narrator will read the hint after the label.

#### acceptsKeyboardFocus

When ```true```, this enables the component to accept keyboard focus. 

#### accessibilityLevel, accessibiiltyPositionInSet, accessibilitySetSize

These properties are used together to define a set of items.
- ```accessibilityLevel``` defines the level of the set
- ```accessibilityPositionInSet``` defines the position of the item in a set
- ```accessibilitySetSize``` defines the number of items in a set

```tsx
<View>
  <Button content="One" accessibilityLevel={1} accessibiltyPositionInSet={1} accessibilitySetSize={2}/>
  <Button content="Two" accessibilityLevel={1} accessibiltyPositionInSet={2} accessibilitySetSize={2}/>
  <View>
    <Button content="Three" accessibilityLevel={2} accessibiltyPositionInSet={1} accessibilitySetSize={3} />
    <Button content="Four" accessibilityLevel={2} accessibiltyPositionInSet={2} accessibilitySetSize={3} />
    <Button content="Five" accessibilityLevel={2} accessibiltyPositionInSet={3} accessibilitySetSize={3} />
  </View>
</View>
```

In the above example, Narrator will read the first button as "One, 1 of 2, level 1" and the second button as "Two, 2 of 
2, level 1" and so on.

### Roles
```accessibilityRole``` communicates the purpose of the component to the user.

### States

```accessibilityStates``` describes the current state of a component to the user.

### Actions

Accessibility actions allow assistive technology to programically invoke actions you provide to a component. In order to
add support an action, a component must do two things:

- Define a list of actions it supports via the accessibilityActions property
- Implement an onAccessibilityAction function handle to handle action requests
