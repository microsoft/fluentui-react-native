# Theming

## What is a theme in FURN?

In FURN, a theme can affect things like typography and spacing, in addition to colors.

Components that are provided by FURN take advantage of the set theme and change their appearance if the theme changes.
A FURN theme can also be applied to other components or scenarios, if you want to build your own components using FURN's frameworks or just want to use the theming system by itself.
FURN has default themes, but also allows for users to customize them in various ways.

The theming system in FURN runs on top of [the Context concept from React](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
